# Archival Disclaimer & Responsible Use Notice

> [!WARNING]
> This repository contains archived government-released materials. Some content may be sensitive, graphic, or legally complex. Viewer discretion is strongly advised.

## 1. Scope & Purpose

This repository exists solely for:

* Archival preservation of publicly released government materials
* Integrity verification and comparison
* Research, journalistic, and academic reference
* Long-term historical documentation

All materials preserved herein originate from official public releases or documented reconstructions of those releases.

This repository does not host or distribute materials obtained through hacking, intrusion, or unauthorized access.

This repository does not create, author, or originate the substantive content contained within archived materials.

---

## 2. Nature of Archived Materials

The archived corpus may contain:

* Sensitive personal information
* Allegations
* Investigative records
* Criminal case documentation
* Redacted and unredacted documents
* Graphic descriptions
* Media files with incomplete or ambiguous context

These materials were originally released by official government entities.

The presence of any name, image, or reference within these documents **does not constitute proof of wrongdoing, guilt, or criminal liability.**

Inclusion in investigative material is not equivalent to conviction or adjudication.

No inference should be drawn solely from archival inclusion.

---

## 3. No Editorial Position

This repository:

* Does not endorse any narrative interpretation
* Does not assert conclusions regarding guilt or innocence
* Does not adopt positions expressed in media coverage
* Does not advocate political or legal outcomes

It functions strictly as a preservation and integrity resource.

---

## 4. Illicit Content & Lawful Publication

Public commentary has speculated regarding the nature of certain datasets.

This repository operates under the reasonable assumption that materials officially released by originating authorities were cleared for public dissemination.

This repository does not knowingly host unlawful material.

If credible evidence demonstrates that any file contains illegal content under applicable law, it will be reviewed and addressed accordingly.

Responsibility for original publication rests solely with the originating authority.

---

## 5. Non-Endorsement of Misuse

This repository does **not** condone or authorize:

* Harassment
* Doxxing
* Vigilantism

Users are solely responsible for how they access, interpret, redistribute, or otherwise utilize archived materials.

---

## 6. Integrity & Non-Modification Statement

Files are preserved in their publicly released form unless explicitly noted for reconstruction, formatting normalization, or technical recovery.

Where reconstruction occurs, it is documented transparently.

This repository does not alter substantive content.

Hash values, manifests, and comparison artifacts may be provided to preserve integrity and enable independent verification.

No representation is made that upstream releases were free from error, omission, or redaction.

---

## 7. Archival Mirror Clarification

This repository functions as a preservation mirror of previously released public materials.

Continued archival availability does not constitute new publication of non-public material.

Subsequent modification or removal of materials by an originating authority does not retroactively alter their prior public release status.
